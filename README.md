## Short Summary:
We students enter the canteen during break times to see a long queue waiting to receive their food. Many times it so happens that, by the time we receive our plate of food,  we are either forced to miss class/work and eat, or waste food and reach class/do work on time. So, we plan on making an app, where students/employees can choose what they would like to eat an hour or two before their breaktime. This would give plenty of time for the chefs to get an idea of what the orders for the day is, and prepare the food in time; and the students/employees could come in and collect their food without any waiting time.

## Introduction: 
We students enter the canteen during break times to see a long queue waiting to receive our food. Many times it so happens that, by the time we receive our plate of food,  we are either forced to miss class and eat, or waste food and reach class on time. Now this just adds on to food wastage which is an alarming issue in India. Restaurants, canteens, etc. spew out so much food. According to UN estimates, 40 percent of the food produced in India is either lost or wasted. With numbers as high as these, the country’s current systems aren’t able to cope up and hence leading to negative effects on the environment and human health.
Therefore, we tried to address the problem with our project wherein the focus would be to minimize wastage by producing the right amount of food and also save students time thereby, giving them the opportunity to utilize their breaks more efficiently than by waiting for food.

## Objective: 
The objective of our project is to design an efficient system to solve the problem of long queues and food wastage in schools, colleges and offices.

## Problem with the present system: 
Canteens in many colleges and offices either prepare food as and when students/employees order them during lunch break, hence, wasting their valuable time or produce food in masses, which when not consumed are thrown mercilessly into bins. Sometimes, students prefer to skip lunch in order to escape the hassle which results in them ruining their health.

## Platform used: Flutter and Dart

## Hack: 
We plan on developing an app to which colleges and corporate offices can register themselves to. The head chef will be allowed to upload the menu for the day a few hours before the break time, giving the students/employees time to decide what they would fancy for snacks/lunch an hour or two before their break time. This also gives the chefs sufficient time to prepare food according to the demand before rush hour. Not only will the app suggest the user food they may like, based on their previous orders but also keeps a check on their calorie intake via a health card to help the current fitness enthusiast generation. In addition to this, the canteens will be allowed to customize the app by adding the option of delivery, etc. Digital transactions will also be made available on the app to help promote a cashless economy.

## Future Enhancements: 
This app can be used in weddings and other social gatherings in the future, hence, allowing the caterers to prepare the required amount of food and reduce wastage. A minimal expansion of the app can be used in hostels to ease the process to a certain extent.
